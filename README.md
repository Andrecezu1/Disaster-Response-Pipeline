## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

When a disaster occurs, there is a need of instantanious information in order to deploy the emergency response forces. In this project I analyze the messages shared during a disaster, build a text processing pipeline and answer the following questions with the analysis made:

1. ¿AAA?
2. ¿BBB?
3. ¿CCC?

The data was given by Udacity and consist in four files:
1. categories.csv
2. DisasterResponseDB
3. messages.csv
4. Twitter-sentiment-self-drive-DFE.csv

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are two (2) notebooks:
1. "ETL Pipeline Preparation.ipynb" is the ETL pipeline used to prepare the data.
2. "ML Pipeline Preparation.ipynb" is the pipeline that trains a classifier to analyze the data.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the web page found [here](AAAAA).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to UDACITY for the data and templates.  Feel free to use the code here as you would like!
